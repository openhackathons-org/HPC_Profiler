    "Although the code runs faster, there are still uncoalesced accesses that we need to address. The issue with the stencil operations is the cache reuse and as the array (problem size) grows, due to the stride between row `j` and row `j+1` , there will be less cache reuse. To solve this issue, we can read the data from the shared memory which is closer to the GPU cores. This will result in accessing the DRAM less. We implement the simplest version for ease but this might not be the best solution. To learn more on how to understand and optimize Shared Memory accesses using Nsight Compute, please watch the [GTC talk](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring22-s41723/) on the same topic.\n",
