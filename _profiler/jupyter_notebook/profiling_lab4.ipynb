    "The **goal** of this lab is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to identify redundant memory copies via NVIDIA Nsight™ Systems\n",
    "- Learn how to improve efficiency by reducing extra data copies via OpenACC data directives\n",
    "- Learn how to use NVIDIA HPC compiler feedback for guidance on where to insert OpenACC data directives\n",
    "- Apply data directives to the parallel application, benchmark and profile the application\n",

    "- The OpenACC programming model\n",
    "- Advanced optimization techniques in detail\n",

    "Let's inspect the profiler report from the previous exercise. From the \"Timeline view\" on the top pane, double-click on \"CUDA\" from the function table on the left and expand it. Zoom in on the timeline and you can see a pattern similar to the screenshot below. The blue boxes are the compute kernels and each of these groupings of kernels is surrounded by purple and green boxes (annotated with a green rectangle) representing data movements. If you hover your mouse over each box, you can see more details.\n",

    "The compiler feedback is telling us that the compiler has inserted data movement around our parallel region at line 278 which copies the `hy_dens_cell`, `hy_dens_theta_cell`, and `state` arrays in and out of GPU memory and also copies `flux` array out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler can only work with the information we provide. It knows we need the `hy_dens_cell`, `hy_dens_theta_cell`, `state`, and `flux` arrays on the GPU for the accelerated section within the  `compute_tendencies_x` function, but we didn't tell the compiler anything about what happens to the data outside of those sections. Without this knowledge, the compiler has to copy the full arrays to the GPU and back to the CPU for each accelerated section. This is a good deal of unnecessary data transfers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would want to move the data (example: `hy_dens_cell`, `hy_dens_theta_cell`, `state` arrays) to the GPU at the beginning, and only transfer it back to the CPU at the end (if needed). And as for the `flux` array in this example, we do not need to copy any data back and forth. So we only need to create space on the device (GPU) for this array. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to give the compiler information about how to reduce the extra and unnecessary data movement. By adding an OpenACC `data` directive to a structured code block, the compiler will know how to manage data according to the clauses. For information on the data directive clauses, please visit [OpenACC 3.0 Specification](https://www.openacc.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/Specification/OpenACC.3.0.pdf).\n",
