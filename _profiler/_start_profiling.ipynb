    "- Learn to follow a cyclical process (analyze, parallelize, optimize) to help you identify the portions of the code that would benefit from GPU acceleration and apply parallelization strategies and optimization techniques to see additional speedups and performance improvements\n",
    "- Understand what a profiler is and which NVIDIA Nsight tool to choose in order to profile your application\n",
    "- Profile a sequential weather modeling application (integrated with NVTX APIs) with Nsight Systems to capture and trace CPU events and time ranges\n",
    "- Understand how to use  Nsight Systems profiler reports to detect hotspots to port the application to the GPU\n",
    "- Learn how to use Nsight Systems to identify issues such as underutilized GPU devices and unnecessary data movements in the application and  apply optimization strategies step by step to expose more parallelism and utilize the computer’s CPU and GPU\n",
